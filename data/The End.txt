Oh yeah, alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
