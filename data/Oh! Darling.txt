Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darling
When you told me (woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
