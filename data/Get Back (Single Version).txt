Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
\u200b\u200b
Go home
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta
Hoo
Go home
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Ooo
(Ooo, ow)
Get back, Loretta
Your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back home, Loretta
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, get back
Get back, oh yeah
Jojo
