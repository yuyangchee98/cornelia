I\u2019d like to be under the sea
In an octopus\u2019s garden in the shade
He\u2019d let us in, knows where we\u2019ve been
In his octopus\u2019s garden in the shade
I\u2019d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus\u2019s garden with me
I\u2019d like to be under the sea
In an octopus\u2019s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus\u2019s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can\u2019t be found
I\u2019d like to be under the sea
In an octopus\u2019s garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they\u2019re happy and they\u2019re safe (Happy and they\u2019re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do
I\u2019d like to be under the sea
In an octopus\u2019s garden with you
In an octopus\u2019s garden with you
In an octopus\u2019s garden with you
